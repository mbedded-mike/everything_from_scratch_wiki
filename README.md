# everything\_from\_scratch 

\- a madman's journey to computing from scratch...

## everything\_you\_need\_to\_know

The objectives of this project are plain and simple: 


[ ] design a \"fully featured\"\* (RV32I) RISC-V CPU (rtl, implemented on a FPGA)


[ ] write a C compiler for the RV32I


[ ] write a very basic OS for the RV32I


[ ] run doom on the CPU ;\] \*\*


\* with a crappy pipeline and without features such as out-of-order execution


\*\* maybe if I manage to design my own HDMI core for my FPGA :)


The goal is to complete those steps while documenting everything of those and making everything open source.

If any of those is empty, it means I'm still working on it or didn't start yet ;\]
